# Publishing 

Publishing to [pub.dev](https://pub.dev) happens automatically via GitHub Actions, with the help of
[firehose rules](https://github.com/dart-lang/ecosystem/tree/main/pkgs/firehose).

There are two CI workflows that enable this automation:

1. [post_summaries.yaml](../../.github/workflows/post_summaries.yaml) - job `publish / validate` runs on pre-submit.
2. [publish.yaml](../../.github/workflows/publish.yaml) - job `publish / publish` runs on tagging.

## Passing the publish / validate job

In general, the job [publish / validate](https://github.com/flutter/genui/actions/workflows/post_summaries.yaml) checks if all pub.dev packages are ready for publishing.

To make sure your PR passes this validation, follow [firehose rules](https://github.com/dart-lang/ecosystem/tree/main/pkgs/firehose).

## Package categories

Packages in this repo fall into the following categories:

1. **Not published**: `pubspec.yaml` contains `publish_to: none`. Workspace tools and example apps that are never pushed to pub.dev.
2. **Not yet published**: the package's `version:` ends with a `-wip<N>` suffix (see "`-wip` vs non-`-wip`" below). Published to pub.dev to reserve the name or to test the package; not ready for general use yet.
3. **Published**: any other package. Each has its own version cadence on pub.dev.

## About `resolution: workspace`

`resolution: workspace` in a `pubspec.yaml`:

1. Tells Dart to share dependency resolution and a lockfile with the monorepo.

2. Tells to use **current repo as a source** for the package, not pub.dev (for local runs).

Note that a package can opt out (by omitting `resolution: workspace`) to have separate dependency resolution.

## `-wip` vs non-`-wip` (production ready) versions

The packages code should be always release ready. That means:

1. Use `-wip` version (format `0.1.0-wip002`) if **at least one** of the following statements is true:

   1.1. The package is planned to be released in the future. In this case it is published with `-wip` suffix in order to reserve the package name.

   1.2. The package's last changes touch only non-publishable code or docs (like tests, tools, or not-publishable docs).

   You can publish `-wip<number>` versions (where `<number>` is a three-digit, zero padded integer like `-wip003`), if you need it for development.

2. Remove `-wip` suffix from a version in `pubspec.yaml`, if your change in this package is publishable.

3. If your feature is partially implemented, hide the feature's code behind a false-by-default flag, and use **release-ready** version. (There is no detailed guidance how to define this flag yet. It should be outlined when it is needed. Please create an issue if you need it soon.)

## Versioning

We use [Semver] for package versioning, although before 1.0.0, we will be
incrementing only the minor number for breaking changes and the patch number for
non-breaking changes. After 1.0.0, we will be using standard Semver, bumping the
major number for breaking changes.

## How publishing happens?

1. **Auto**: The workflow job `publish / validate` will:
   - check if the PR follows [firehose rules](https://github.com/dart-lang/ecosystem/tree/main/pkgs/firehose).
   - add a table [like this](https://github.com/flutter/genui/pull/941#issuecomment-4556675732) to each PR.

2. **Manual**: After reviewing and merging the PR, for each 'ready to publish' version the author of the PR should run `flutter pub publish` or `dart pub publish`.

## How upgrade of dependencies happens?

### For run in workspace

For packages with `resolution: workspace` in their pubspec.yaml, pub resolves every sibling from its local source directory — not from pub.dev, as long as its `version:` satisfies the consumer's constraint.

If a local bump escapes that constraint (e.g. `^0.9.0` → `0.10.0`), you must update the consumer's `pubspec.yaml` in the same PR. While `dart pub` natively silently falls back to the published version on pub.dev, **our `test_and_fix` CI suite contains a verification step that will explicitly throw an error** and fail your PR if internal workspace version constraints are not met.

### For global dependencies

After a new version of a dependency is published, this is how upgrade will happen:

1. [Dependabot] detects the new version on pub.dev and opens a PR per dependency, bumping the constraint in each consuming `pubspec.yaml`. See [About Dependabot version updates] for details.
2. The PR runs `publish / validate` and the rest of CI.
3. A maintainer reviews and merges the PR.

## How to configure GitHub and pub.dev for auto-publishing?

GitHub and pub.dev are already configured for auto-publishing. This section is here in case this needs to be reproduced for new repo or new package. 

Note that you need to have administrative permissions to update configuration.

### Setup org permissions

In https://github.com/organizations/flutter/settings/actions:

1. Find the section "Allow or block specified actions and reusable workflows"
2. Add these values (if they are already here, they will be de-dupped automatically):

   ```
   peter-evans/create-or-update-comment@*,
   peter-evans/create-pull-request@*,
   peter-evans/repository-dispatch@*,
   dart-lang/ecosystem/.github/workflows/publish.yaml@*,
   dart-lang/ecosystem/.github/workflows/post_summaries.yaml@*,
   ```

### Configure pub.dev for each package 

This requires uploader/admin rights on the package.

1. Go to https://pub.dev/packages/<YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME>/admin
2. Under "Automated publishing", enable "Publishing from GitHub Actions" for both `push` and `workflow_dispatch` events.
3. Set Repository to `<YOUR_ORG>/<YOUR_REPO>`.
4. Set Tag pattern to `<YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME>-v{{version}}`.
